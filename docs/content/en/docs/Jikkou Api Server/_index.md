**Jikkou API Server** provides a REST interface to any platform supported by Jikkou, making it even easier to manage,
automate and visualise all your data platform assets.

**Jikkou CLI** can be used in combination with Jikkou API Server by configuring it in proxy mode. In this mode, the CLI no
longer connects directly to your various platforms, but forwards all operations to the API server.
This deployment method allows you to enhance the overall security of the platforms managed through Jikkou.
