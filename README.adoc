== Introduction

**https://github.com/streamthoughts/jikkou[Jikkou]** (jikk≈ç / ÂÆüË°å) is an open-source tool designed to provide an easier way to
manage the configurations on your Data Stream platform.

Developed by Kafka ‚ù§Ô∏è, Jikkou aims to streamline daily operations on https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/[Apache Kafka],
ensuring that platform governance is no longer a boring and tedious task for both **Developers** and **Administrators**.

Jikkou enables a declarative management approach of **Topics**, **ACLs**, **Quotas**, and even more with the use of YAML files called **_Resource Definitions_**.

Taking inspiration from `kubectl` and Kubernetes resource definition files, Jikkou offers an intuitive and user-friendly approach to configuration management.

== Motivation

See https://medium.com/@fhussonnois/why-is-managing-kafka-topics-still-such-a-pain-introducing-jikkou-4ee9d5df948[this blog post] for more details.

== The main usage scenarios

* Create new resource entities on an Apache Kafka cluster (i.e., _Topics_, _ACLs_, and _Quotas_).
* Update the configurations of existing resource entities.
* Delete resource entities which are not anymore managed.
* Describe all the configuration defined for Brokers.
* Describe all the configuration defined for _Topics_, _ACLs_, and _Quotas_.
* Replicate configurations of a production cluster to another with a few command lines.
* Initialize a new cluster for testing purpose.

== Core features that make it awesome

* Simple command line interface (CLI) for end user.
* Simple Java API on top of the Kafka's  https://kafka.apache.org/30/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/Admin.html[Java AdminClient].
* Completely stateless and thus does not store any state (Basically: _Your kafka cluster is the state of Jikkou_).
* Pluggable validation rules to ensure that resources meet your requirement before being created or updated ona target cluster.
* Pluggable resource manager to extend Jikkou with cloud managed services for Apache Kafka which are supported out-of-the-box.
* Simple templating mechanism using https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/[Jinja] notation.

== Quick Installation

Jikkou is available:

* As a zip/tar.gz package from https://github.com/streamthoughts/jikkou/releases/tag/v0.21.0[GitHub Releases]
* As a fatJar available from https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/streamthoughts/jikkou/0.21.0/[Maven Central]
* As a docker image available from https://hub.docker.com/r/streamthoughts/jikkou[Docker Hub].
* As a Debian package from https://github.com/streamthoughts/jikkou/releases/tag/v0.21.0[GitHub Releases]

[source, bash]
----
wget https://github.com/streamthoughts/jikkou/releases/download/v0.21.0/jikkou.deb
sudo dpkg -i jikkou.deb
----

NOTE: Jikkou will install itself in the directory :  `/opt/jikkou`

It is recommended to install the bash/zsh completion script `jikkou_completion`:

[source, bash]
----
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamthoughts/jikkou/master/jikkou_completion . jikkou_completion
----

or alternatively, run the following command for generation the completion script.

[source, bash]
----
source <(jikkou generate-completion)
----

== Overview

It allows you to define the desired current state of your **Topics**, **ACLs**, or **Quotas**, using one or more YAML resource definition files :

kafka-topics.yml:::
[source,yaml]
----
# file:./kafka-topics.yml
apiVersion: 'kafka.jikkou.io/v1beta2'
kind: 'KafkaTopic'
metadata:
  name: 'my-first-topic-with-jikkou'
  labels: {}
  annotations: {}
spec:
  partitions: 12
  replicas: 3
  configs:
    min.insync.replicas: 2
----

It will then take care of computing and applying the necessary changes directly to your cluster.

[source, bash]
----
$ jikkou apply -f ./kafka-topics.yml
----

[source]
----
TASK [CREATE] Create a new topic my-first-topic-with-jikkou (partitions=12, replicas=3) - CHANGED **********************
----
[source, json]
----
{
  "changed" : true,
  "end" : 1634071489773,
  "resource" : {
    "name" : "my-first-topic-with-jikkou",
    "operation" : "ADD",
    "partitions" : {
      "after" : 12,
      "operation" : "ADD"
    },
    "replicas" : {
      "after" : 3,
      "operation" : "ADD"
    },
    "configs" : {
      "min.insync.replicas" : {
        "after" : "2",
        "operation" : "ADD"
      }
    }
  },
  "failed" : false,
  "status" : "CHANGED"
}

Most of the time, you will use Jikkou part of your CI/CD pipeline allowing you to version and ship your Apache Kafka resources directly from Git (more on https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/[GitOps])

Jikkou can be used with self-hosted Kafka, managed Kafka and Confluent Cloud.

NOTE: you can use the environment variable `JIKKOU_DEFAULT_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` for connection to the Kafka cluster (instead of the CLI arg `--bootstrap-servers`)
