== Introduction

**https://github.com/streamthoughts/jikkou[Jikkou]** (jikk≈ç / ÂÆüË°å) is an open-source tool designed to provide an efficient and easy way to
manage, automate, and provision resource configurations for Kafka, Schema Registry, etc.

Developed by Kafka ‚ù§Ô∏è, Jikkou aims to streamline daily operations on https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/[Apache Kafka],
ensuring that platform governance is no longer a boring and tedious task for both **Developers** and **Administrators**.

Jikkou enables a declarative management approach of **Topics**, **ACLs**, **Quotas**, **Schemas** and even more with the use of YAML files called **_Resource Definitions_**.

Taking inspiration from `kubectl` and Kubernetes resource definition files, Jikkou offers an intuitive and user-friendly approach to configuration management.

Jikkou can be used with https://kafka.apache.org/[Apache Kafka], https://aiven.io/kafka[Aiven], https://aws.amazon.com/fr/msk/[MSK], and https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/[Confluent Cloud].

== Motivation

See https://medium.com/@fhussonnois/why-is-managing-kafka-topics-still-such-a-pain-introducing-jikkou-4ee9d5df948[this blog post] for more details.

|===

Alternatively, jikkou is also available:

* As a fatJar available from https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/streamthoughts/jikkou/0.25.0/[Maven Central]
* As a Docker Image available from https://hub.docker.com/r/streamthoughts/jikkou[Docker Hub].

Download the jikkou binary from the https://github.com/streamthoughts/jikkou/releases[releases page], uncompress
and copy to the desired location.

[source, bash]
----
# Download the latest stable release
wget https://github.com/streamthoughts/jikkou/releases/download/v0.26.0/jikkou-0.26.0-linux-x86_64.zip

# Uncompress
unzip jikkou-0.26.0-linux-x86_64.zip

# Copy to the desired location
cp jikkou-0.26.0-linux-x86_64/bin/jikkou $HOME/.local/bin
----

It is recommended to install the bash/zsh completion script `jikkou_completion`:

[source, bash]
----
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamthoughts/jikkou/main/jikkou_completion . jikkou_completion
----

or alternatively, run the following command for generation the completion script.

[source, bash]
----
source <(jikkou generate-completion)
----

WARNING: If you are using macOS you may need to remove the quarantine attribute from the bits before you can use them
         To do this, run the following: `sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine path/to/jikkou/folder/`

== Overview

Here is an example of how to create and manage a _Kafka topic_ using Jikkou:

* Create a resource file _kafka-topics.yaml_:
kafka-topics.yaml:::
[source,yaml]
----
# file:./kafka-topics.yaml
apiVersion: 'kafka.jikkou.io/v1beta2'
kind: 'KafkaTopic'
metadata:
  name: 'my-first-topic-with-jikkou'
  labels: {}
  annotations: {}
spec:
  partitions: 12
  replicas: 3
  configs:
    min.insync.replicas: 2
----

* Then run the following command:

[source, bash]
----
$ jikkou apply --files ./kafka-topics.yaml
----

Jikkou will then take care of computing and applying the necessary changes directly to your cluster.

_(output)_:
[source]
----
TASK [CREATE] Create a new topic my-first-topic-with-jikkou (partitions=12, replicas=3) - CHANGED **********************
----

    },
    "configs" : {
      "min.insync.replicas" : {

== üè≠ Developers

You need to have  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java] and https://www.docker.com/[Docker] installed.

=== Dependencies

Jikkou CLI is built with https://micronaut.io/[Micronaut] and https://picocli.info/[Picocli]

To build the project you will need:

* Java 17
* https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM] 22.1.0 or newer to create native executable
* https://testcontainers.com/[TestContainer] to run integration tests

=== Build project

This project includes https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/[Maven Wrapper].

Below are the commands commonly used to build the project:

[source,bash]
----
# Build and run all tests
./mvnw clean verify

# Build and skip integration tests
./mvnw clean verify -DskipTests
----

=== Build Docker Images (locally)

[source,bash]
----
$ make
----

=== Create Native Executable

[source,bash]
----
# Build and run all tests
./mvnw clean verify -Pnative
----

You can then execute the native executable with: `./jikkou-cli/target/jikkou-$PROJECT_VERSION-runner`

=== Create Debian Package (on Linux)

[source,bash]
----
# Build and run all tests
./mvnw clean package -Pnative
./mvnw package -Pdeb
----

You can then install the package with: `sudo dpkg -i ./dist/jikkou-$PROJECT_VERSION-linux-x86_64.deb`

NOTE: Jikkou will install itself in the directory :  `/opt/jikkou`

=== Formats

This project uses the Maven plugin https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/master/plugin-maven[Spotless]
to format all Java classes and to apply some code quality checks.
